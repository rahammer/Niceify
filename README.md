# Niceify
HackAZ project 2017 that turns any mean non-capitalized message into a nice message.

The objective of my hack was to create a Java Applet that can filter or replace negative statements to create a nice statement and reduce online harassment. I dreamt of this app filtering negative statements when the human mind is not conscious enough or too tired to withhold negativity or skepticism. Currently is requires the text to be copied and pasted into the desired instant messaging app or email, but later on I plan to properly interface it to such applications. I also plan to tweak it to create a greater grammatical efficiency and event specific functions.
